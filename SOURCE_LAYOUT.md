# Source ownership and generation

`.agents/` is the only authored home for host-neutral React and TypeScript capabilities. This single-scope
repository uses `.agents/<kind>/<name>/SKILL.md`; it does not repeat a `react/` wrapper because the repository
already supplies that scope. A definition contains the full instruction body and applicability metadata.

`.agents/plugins/manifests/` contains authored Codex and Claude manifest inputs. `.codex/` contains Codex-only
generated discovery entries. `.claude/` contains Claude-only generated discovery entries. Host discovery files
never become a second authored definition.

`plugins/react/` is a generated self-contained distribution. The two root marketplace files and
`.agents/INDEX.md` are generated too. Edit no generated body. Regenerate with
`pwsh .agents/sync-generated.ps1` and prove zero drift with `pwsh .agents/sync-generated.ps1 -Check`.
