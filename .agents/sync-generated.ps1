Regenerates everything in this repo that is derived from `.agents/` and `standards/`.

Two kinds of skill live here, and the difference is what gets generated:

  a STANDARD   the rule text is a doc under `standards/<domain>/`, and `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
               is a router: front matter plus the doc's root-relative path in backticks. A doc is a
               plain markdown file, so it can be `@`-imported by a repo that wants it always-on or
               routed to by its skill everywhere else. Text inside a SKILL.md gets one delivery mode.

  a UTILITY    a procedure the agent runs (`sync`, `worktree`, `recents`). There is no corpus to
               consult, so the body stays in its SKILL.md and no doc exists.

Generated:
  .claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md   for a harness opened on THIS repo. A router is copied verbatim -
                                   its root-relative doc path resolves because cwd is this repo. A
                                   utility gets a stub pointing at canonical, so its body is not
                                   duplicated.
  standards/<domain>/INDEX.md      the tree answers "where is it"; this answers "did I document this"
                                   without opening anything.
  plugins/<p>/skills/…             router copy with its doc path rewritten relative to the SKILL.md,
                                   and plugins/<p>/standards/… a full copy of the domains that plugin
                                   claims. An installed plugin is only its own subtree and cwd is the
                                   consuming project, so a root-relative path would dangle and a
                                   reference outside the plugin root is never copied at all.
  .agents/plugins/marketplace.json and .claude-plugin/marketplace.json are authored separately because
                                   the two harnesses require different schemas. Each plugin carries both
                                   .claude-plugin/plugin.json and .codex-plugin/plugin.json.

Plugins carry the domains `.agents/plugins/payloads.json` assigns them: a .NET project installs
`dotnet-standards` from `tomjseery/dotagents` and must not also receive this corpus. This repo holds only
routers, so nothing here generates a utility stub. The write-time router hook lives in
`Concertable/agent-standards` and ships in its `agent-process` plugin, so a project wanting enforcement
installs that too. Apart from this paragraph the script is byte-identical to the `dotagents` copy;
`ARCHITECTURE.md` there records why the copies are kept rather than shared.

Refuses to write when the two structures disagree: a router naming a doc that does not exist, a doc no
router points at, or two routers claiming one doc. A tree and a skill namespace that can drift is
exactly how 754 lines of frontend law ended up with zero inbound links.
