Regenerates everything in this repo that is derived from `.agents/`.

Two kinds of skill live here, told apart by ONE authored fact - a `domain:` field in front matter:

  a STANDARD   declares `domain:`, and its SKILL.md body IS the standard. There is no separate doc:
               `@`-import only expands inside CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md, never inside a SKILL.md, so a skill
               pointing at a doc could only ever be a pointer - costing a guaranteed Read tool call for
               content the invocation was always going to need. The domain decides which plugin ships it.

  a UTILITY    declares no `domain:` - a procedure the agent runs (`sync`, `worktree`, `recents`). It is
               machine tooling, not a standard, so it ships in no plugin and no domain claims it.

A generic standard and its Concertable counterpart pair by SKILL NAME and are told apart by PLUGIN
NAMESPACE - `dotnet-standards:persistence` here, `dotnet:persistence` in Concertable/agent-standards.
Nothing pairs by file path any more; the skill name already carried that fact.

Generated:
  .claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md   for a harness opened on THIS repo. A standard is copied verbatim; a
                                   utility gets a stub pointing at canonical, so its body is not
                                   duplicated.
  SKILLS.md                        the catalogue: skill -> what it covers -> owning plugin. Answers "did
                                   I write this rule down, and which skill owns it" without opening
                                   anything, which is what the per-domain standards INDEX used to answer.
  plugins/<p>/skills/…             verbatim copy of each standard whose domain that plugin claims. An
                                   installed plugin is only its own subtree, and a plugin cannot
                                   reference anything outside its root, so the payload is a full copy.
  .agents/plugins/marketplace.json and .claude-plugin/marketplace.json are authored separately because
                                   the two harnesses require different schemas. Each plugin carries both
                                   .claude-plugin/plugin.json and .codex-plugin/plugin.json.

Plugins carry the domains `.agents/plugins/payloads.json` assigns them: a .NET project installs
`dotnet-standards` from `tomjseery/dotagents` and must not also receive this corpus. This repo holds only
standards, so nothing here declares a utility or generates its stub. The write-time router hook lives in
`Concertable/agent-standards` and ships in its `agent-process` plugin, so a project wanting enforcement
installs that too. Apart from this paragraph the script is byte-identical to the `dotagents` copy;
`ARCHITECTURE.md` there records why the copies are kept rather than shared.

Refuses to write when the skill namespace and the payload split disagree: a skill whose domain no plugin
ships, or a plugin claiming a domain no skill declares. Two structures that can drift is exactly how 754
lines of frontend law ended up with zero inbound links.
