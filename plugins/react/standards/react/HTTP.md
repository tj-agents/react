# HTTP layer

## One `xApi` object per resource

`features/<feature>/api/xApi.ts` default-exports an object literal of `async` arrow methods that call the
shared axios instance, type the response on the generic, destructure `{ data }`, and return it. A typed api
module kept out of components is the standard data-layer split, and it mirrors the server-side rule that an
outbound call gets a typed contract rather than hand-rolled request plumbing.

```ts
const orderApi = {
  checkout: async (orderId: number): Promise<Checkout> => {
    const { data } = await api.post<Checkout>(`/order/${orderId}/checkout`);
    return data;
  },
};
export default orderApi;
```

- Type the call at `api.get<T>` / `api.post<T>` and return `data`; the generic flows through to
  `AxiosResponse<T>.data`.
- Bodyless endpoints use the bare call with no generic. Binary reads pass
  `{ responseType: "arraybuffer" }` and wrap the result in a `Blob`.
- A package-local api file that only re-exposes a shared one is a **pure re-export**, never a copy.
- Never hand-roll ad-hoc fetching where the api object expresses the call.

## One instance per backend service: bare in core, enhanced in the app tree

A multi-service backend forces one client instance **per backend the site calls**, and two layers, because
*which* backends a site may call and *with what token* is an app-level decision:

- **Core (`lib/*Client.ts`):** `axios.create()` only — the bare instance. No base URL, no auth, no interceptors;
  the core package cannot know the site's identity.
- **App tree:** side-effect-imports the instance and enhances it through one shared fluent builder —
  `configureClient(instance, url).withAuth(getToken, onUnauthorized).withTenant(getTenantId, header)`. The
  interceptor bodies live **once** in the builder; each platform binds its auth flavour once, and a
  multi-tenant app chains the tenant header.

Only the client whose backend genuinely needs it carries a query-string serializer (an array-param format
its server binder expects); the others send no array query params.

**Litmus:** *does this touch the user's token or tenant? → the builder chain in the app tree, never
`lib/*Client.ts`.*

**The anti-patterns:** a second client for a backend that already has one — configure it, don't recreate
it — and auth wiring in the core factory.

## Errors are resolved once, at the query client

The error body is the framework's problem-details shape (RFC 9457: `{ title, detail, errors[] }`) and is
handled in **exactly one place**: the global `onError` on React Query's `QueryCache` and `MutationCache`.
Feature hooks and components **do not** `try/catch` to report errors — the client already did.

Keep the platform-agnostic half — the problem-details and error-meta types, plus the policy function that
classifies an error into what to surface (or into nothing, to swallow it) — in the shared package so every
platform reuses it. Only the toast *rendering* belongs to the platform's own query client.

- **The only opt-out is typed `meta`** on the `useQuery` or `useMutation` call: `silenceErrors` to swallow
  the report entirely, or `expectedErrors: [404]` for a status the caller handles itself — both registered
  through React Query's module augmentation.
- **Shared retry policy:** network errors and transient statuses only (`408/429/502/503/504`), max 2 retries.
- **The one legitimate inspection is control flow, not reporting** — a route guard branching on 401 to throw
  a redirect. It goes through the **shared error seam** (`isApiError(e) && e.status === 401`); axios's own
  `isAxiosError`/`AxiosError` and any read of `error.response` stay confined to the shared client and its
  interceptor, and feature code never imports them.

```ts
// CORRECT — the caller expects 404 and renders its own empty state; the client stays silent
useQuery({ queryKey, queryFn, meta: { expectedErrors: [404] } });

// WRONG — a second, generic toast on top of the one the client already fired
useMutation({ mutationFn, onError: () => toast.error("Failed to save.") });
```

**The anti-patterns — each an observable double-report bug, not a style nit:**

- **A feature-local `onError` toast**, firing on top of the global handler.
- **A `try/catch` around a `mutateAsync` call to toast** — the same double-report, spelled with a catch.
- **A validation message shown via toast** — that belongs inline beside the field, from the parse result
  (see the `write-boundary` skill).

**Litmus:** *writing a `catch` to toast an API error? Stop — the query client already did. Catch only to
change control flow.*
