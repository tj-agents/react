# Server state

## React Query owns all server state

Every server **read** is a `useQuery` and every server **write** is a `useMutation`, wrapped in a per-feature hook
(naming in the `react-structure` skill). **Never call an api module from a `useEffect`, and never hand-roll
`useState` + `useEffect` + a promise to load or send server data.**

React Query already owns caching, request **dedup** (including a strict-mode dev double-mount), retries,
routing errors to the central `QueryCache`/`MutationCache` handler, and `isPending`/`isError` state. A fetching `useEffect` re-implements
all of that by hand and worse: it double-fires under strict mode, drops the result when the component
unmounts before the promise settles, and races on out-of-order responses. Those are the exact bugs the
library exists to remove.

**This holds even for a one-shot, fire-on-mount action** — accepting an invitation from an emailed link, for
instance. That is a `useQuery`, which fires on mount and dedupes by key, not
`useEffect(() => { api.accept(id).then(navigate) }, [])`. The success side effects run at the tail of the
`queryFn`, not in a follow-up effect reacting to the result.

> **Anti-pattern:** `useEffect(() => { api.getX().then(setX) }, [])`, or an on-mount `mutate()` guarded by a
> `useRef` to dodge the strict-mode re-fire. Both are a hand-rolled reimplementation of `useQuery`.

**Litmus:** *reading or writing server data? → a `useQuery`/`useMutation` hook. Reaching for `useEffect` or
`useState` to load or send it? → that's the violation.*

## Query keys — arrays, generic to specific, one factory per feature

Keys are arrays ordered most-generic to most-specific with the resource name first —
`["shipments", "order", orderId]` — so invalidation works by prefix. Centralize a feature's
keys in one exported factory object, so a key and its invalidations cannot drift apart across files.

## Mutation variables versus form state

- **The live controlled-input buffer is local `useState` in the component.** It is *not* an `XRequest`, and
  it **never holds server data copied out of the query cache** — copying breaks background refetch.
- On submit, the component maps its buffer to the `XRequest` and passes that as the mutation's **variables**.
- **The mutation hook binds everything constant for its lifetime** — route ids, success invalidations — and
  takes only the per-submit variables. Don't thread a fixed id through the mutation call if the hook already
  closed over it.

The parse that turns a buffer into a request is the `write-boundary` skill's subject.

**Litmus:** *changes per submit → a mutation variable. Fixed for the hook's life → bound inside the hook.*
